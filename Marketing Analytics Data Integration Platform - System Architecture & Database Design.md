The system follows a modern three-tier architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns between presentation, business logic, and data layers. The architecture is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and secure, with each component serving specific responsibilities within the overall system.

The presentation layer consists of a React-based single-page application that provides the user interface for project management, credential configuration, and data visualization. This layer communicates with the backend through RESTful API calls and provides real-time updates through WebSocket connections for long-running data extraction processes.

The business logic layer is implemented using Flask, a Python web framework that handles API requests, manages authentication and authorization, orchestrates data extraction from various marketing platforms, and provides webhook endpoints for Excel integration. This layer also includes background job processing for scheduled data extraction and caching mechanisms for improved performance.

The data layer utilizes PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing user accounts, projects, API credentials, and extracted marketing data. Redis is employed as a caching layer and message broker for background job processing. The system also includes secure credential storage using encryption at rest and proper key management practices.

### 1.3 Core Components

The platform consists of several core components that work together to provide comprehensive marketing data integration capabilities. The User Management System handles user registration, authentication, and authorization using JWT tokens. It supports role-based access control and multi-tenant architecture to ensure data isolation between different users and organizations.

The Project Management System allows users to create and organize multiple projects, each with its own set of API credentials and data extraction configurations. Projects serve as logical containers for grouping related marketing campaigns or business units, enabling better organization and access control.

The Credential Management System provides secure storage and management of API credentials for various marketing platforms. It implements encryption at rest, secure key rotation, and audit logging for credential access. The system supports different authentication methods including OAuth2, API keys, and service account credentials.

The Data Integration Engine is responsible for connecting to various marketing APIs, extracting data according to configured schedules, transforming data into standardized formats, and storing processed data in the database. This component includes retry mechanisms, error handling, and rate limiting to ensure reliable data extraction.

The Webhook System provides RESTful endpoints that Excel and other external systems can call to retrieve processed marketing data. It supports various data formats including JSON, CSV, and XML, with configurable filtering and aggregation options.

The Background Job System handles scheduled data extraction, credential refresh operations, and data cleanup tasks. It uses Celery with Redis as the message broker to ensure reliable job processing and monitoring.


## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Technology Stack

The platform leverages a modern technology stack that balances performance, developer productivity, and operational reliability. The frontend is built using React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and improved developer experience. The component library utilizes Material-UI for consistent design patterns and responsive layouts. State management is handled through Redux Toolkit for complex application state and React Query for server state management and caching.

The backend API is implemented using Flask 2.3 with Python 3.11, providing a lightweight yet powerful foundation for the REST API. Flask-RESTful is used for API endpoint organization, Flask-SQLAlchemy for database ORM, Flask-Migrate for database migrations, and Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT token management. The backend also incorporates Celery for background job processing and APScheduler for scheduled tasks.

The database layer uses PostgreSQL 15 as the primary database, chosen for its reliability, ACID compliance, and excellent support for JSON data types. Redis 7 serves as both a caching layer and message broker for background jobs. The system also integrates with AWS S3 or compatible object storage for file uploads and data exports.

Security components include bcrypt for password hashing, cryptography library for credential encryption, and python-jose for JWT token handling. The system implements CORS policies, rate limiting through Flask-Limiter, and input validation using Marshmallow schemas.

### 2.2 Component Architecture

The system architecture follows a modular design with clear interfaces between components. The API Gateway serves as the entry point for all client requests, handling authentication, rate limiting, and request routing. It implements middleware for logging, error handling, and security headers.

The Authentication Service manages user login, registration, and token validation. It supports multiple authentication methods including email/password, OAuth2 social login, and API key authentication for webhook access. The service maintains user sessions and handles token refresh operations.

The Project Service provides CRUD operations for project management, including project creation, configuration updates, and access control. It enforces business rules for project ownership and sharing permissions.

The Credential Service handles secure storage and retrieval of API credentials for various marketing platforms. It implements encryption at rest using AES-256 encryption and provides secure credential rotation capabilities. The service also validates credential formats and tests connectivity to ensure credentials are working properly.

The Integration Service orchestrates data extraction from various marketing APIs. It implements a plugin architecture where each marketing platform is handled by a dedicated integration module. This design allows for easy addition of new platforms and independent updates to existing integrations.

The Data Processing Service transforms raw API responses into standardized data formats suitable for storage and analysis. It handles data validation, deduplication, and aggregation operations. The service also implements data quality checks and error reporting.

The Webhook Service provides external API endpoints for data access. It implements authentication, authorization, and data filtering based on project permissions. The service supports various output formats and implements caching for frequently requested data.

The Background Job Service manages asynchronous operations including scheduled data extraction, credential refresh, and data cleanup tasks. It provides job monitoring, retry mechanisms, and failure notifications.

### 2.3 Data Flow Architecture

The platform implements a comprehensive data flow that ensures reliable data extraction, processing, and delivery. The process begins when users configure API credentials and data extraction schedules through the web interface. The system validates credentials and creates background jobs for data extraction.

The Data Extraction Pipeline operates on scheduled intervals, connecting to each configured marketing API and retrieving data according to specified parameters. The pipeline implements exponential backoff for rate limiting, comprehensive error handling for API failures, and data validation to ensure data quality.

Raw data from marketing APIs is processed through the Data Transformation Pipeline, which normalizes data formats, applies business rules and calculations, handles data deduplication and conflict resolution, and stores processed data in the database with proper indexing for efficient querying.

The Webhook Data Pipeline provides real-time access to processed data through RESTful endpoints. When Excel or other external systems make webhook requests, the pipeline retrieves relevant data from the database, applies requested filters and aggregations, formats data according to client requirements, and returns the response with appropriate caching headers.

### 2.4 Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple layers throughout the system architecture. The Network Security layer includes HTTPS enforcement for all communications, CORS policies to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests, and rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.

Application Security implements JWT-based authentication with secure token generation and validation, role-based access control (RBAC) for fine-grained permissions, input validation and sanitization for all user inputs, and SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries and ORM usage.

Data Security ensures encryption at rest for sensitive data including API credentials, secure key management using environment variables and key rotation, audit logging for all credential access and data operations, and data isolation between different users and projects.

API Security includes authentication requirements for all endpoints, authorization checks based on user roles and project ownership, rate limiting per user and per endpoint, and comprehensive logging of all API access for security monitoring.


## 3. Database Design

### 3.1 Entity Relationship Model

The database design follows a normalized approach with clear relationships between entities while maintaining flexibility for future extensions. The core entities include Users, Projects, Credentials, Data Sources, Extracted Data, and Webhook Configurations.

The User entity serves as the central identity management component, storing user account information, authentication details, and profile settings. Users can own multiple projects and have role-based permissions within the system.

The Project entity represents logical groupings of marketing data integration configurations. Each project belongs to a user and can contain multiple data sources and credential configurations. Projects provide data isolation and access control boundaries.

The Credential entity stores encrypted API credentials for various marketing platforms. Credentials are associated with specific projects and data sources, ensuring proper access control and credential isolation.

The Data Source entity defines the configuration for each marketing platform integration within a project. It specifies which APIs to connect to, what data to extract, and how frequently to perform extractions.

The Extracted Data entity stores the processed marketing data retrieved from various APIs. This entity uses a flexible JSON structure to accommodate different data formats from various marketing platforms while maintaining queryability.

The Webhook Configuration entity defines the webhook endpoints and their associated parameters, including authentication requirements, data filtering rules, and output formats.

```

### 3.5 Indexing Strategy

The database implements a comprehensive indexing strategy to ensure optimal query performance across all common access patterns. Primary indexes include unique constraints on user emails, project names within users, and platform credentials within projects.

Performance indexes are created on frequently queried columns including user_id and created_at on projects table, project_id and platform on credentials table, data_source_id and data_date on extracted_data table, and webhook_config_id and created_at on api_access_logs table.

Composite indexes optimize complex queries such as (project_id, is_active) on data_sources table for active source lookups, (data_source_id, data_type, data_date) on extracted_data table for time-series queries, and (ip_address, created_at) on api_access_logs table for rate limiting checks.

JSON indexes are implemented on JSONB columns to enable efficient querying of nested data structures, including GIN indexes on extraction_config and processed_data columns for flexible data filtering and search capabilities.

### 3.6 Data Retention and Archival

The system implements a tiered data retention strategy to manage storage costs while maintaining data availability for analysis. Recent data (last 90 days) is kept in the primary extracted_data table for fast access and real-time reporting.

Historical data (90 days to 2 years) is moved to an archived_data table with similar structure but optimized for storage efficiency. This data remains queryable but with potentially slower access times.

Long-term data (older than 2 years) is exported to object storage in compressed formats and removed from the database. The system maintains metadata about archived data to enable retrieval if needed.

The retention policy is configurable per project, allowing users to specify their data retention requirements based on business needs and compliance requirements. Automated cleanup jobs run daily to enforce retention policies and maintain optimal database performance.


## 4. API Design

}
```

### 4.3 Webhook API Specifications

The Webhook API provides external access to marketing data for Excel and other third-party integrations. Webhook endpoints are designed for high performance and reliability with built-in caching and rate limiting.

The primary webhook endpoint structure follows this pattern:

```
GET /webhook/v1/{webhook_key}/data
GET /webhook/v1/{webhook_key}/summary
GET /webhook/v1/{webhook_key}/metrics
```

Webhook authentication uses API key-based authentication with the webhook key serving as both identifier and authentication token. Each webhook request must include the webhook key in the URL path and optionally additional authentication headers for enhanced security.

The webhook data endpoint supports various query parameters for data filtering and formatting:

```
GET /webhook/v1/{webhook_key}/data?
  platform=google_ads,facebook_ads&
  start_date=2025-06-01&
  end_date=2025-06-30&
  metrics=impressions,clicks,cost&
  format=csv&
  aggregate=daily
```

Response formats include JSON (default), CSV, and XML. The CSV format is optimized for Excel import with proper headers and data type formatting. Example CSV response:

```csv
Date,Platform,Campaign,Impressions,Clicks,Cost,Conversions
2025-06-01,google_ads,Summer Campaign,15420,342,156.78,23
2025-06-01,facebook_ads,Brand Awareness,8934,189,89.45,12
```

### 4.4 Real-time Updates and WebSockets

The platform implements WebSocket connections for real-time updates during data extraction processes. This allows the frontend to display live progress updates and handle long-running extraction jobs gracefully.

WebSocket endpoints include:

```
WS /ws/v1/projects/{project_id}/extraction-status
WS /ws/v1/projects/{project_id}/data-updates
WS /ws/v1/system/notifications
```

WebSocket messages follow a standardized format with message types including extraction_started, extraction_progress, extraction_completed, extraction_failed, data_updated, and system_notification.

Example WebSocket message:

```json
{
  "type": "extraction_progress",
  "data": {
    "job_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",

  "error": {
    "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
    "message": "Invalid request parameters",
    "details": {
      "field": "start_date",
      "issue": "Date format must be YYYY-MM-DD"
    },
    "request_id": "req_123456789",
    "timestamp": "2025-07-01T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

Common error codes include AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED (401), AUTHORIZATION_FAILED (403), VALIDATION_ERROR (400), RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND (404), RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED (429), and INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (500).

The API implements rate limiting with different limits for different endpoint categories. Authentication endpoints have stricter limits to prevent brute force attacks, while data access endpoints have higher limits to support normal usage patterns. Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 1000
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 999
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1625097600
```

### 4.6 API Versioning and Backward Compatibility

The API uses URL path versioning (e.g., /api/v1/) to ensure backward compatibility as the platform evolves. Version deprecation follows a structured timeline with advance notice to API consumers.

New API versions are introduced when breaking changes are necessary, while non-breaking changes are added to existing versions. The platform maintains support for at least two major API versions simultaneously to provide smooth migration paths for integrations.
