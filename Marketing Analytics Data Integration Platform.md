Example VBA code for retrieving marketing data:

```vba
Sub RefreshMarketingData()
    Dim http As Object
    Dim url As String
    Dim apiKey As String
    Dim response As String
    
    Set http = CreateObject("MSXML2.XMLHTTP")
    url = "https://your-platform-domain.com/webhook/v1/projects/your-project-id/data/your-data-source-id"
    apiKey = "your_api_key_here"
    
    http.Open "GET", url, False
    http.setRequestHeader "Authorization", "Bearer " & apiKey
    http.setRequestHeader "Accept", "application/json"
    http.send
    
    If http.Status = 200 Then
        response = http.responseText
        ' Process the JSON response and populate Excel cells
        Call ProcessMarketingData(response)
    Else
        MsgBox "Error retrieving data: " & http.Status
    End If
End Sub
```

**Error Handling:**
VBA integration includes comprehensive error handling to manage common issues such as network connectivity problems, authentication failures, and data format errors. The error handling code provides clear feedback to users and includes retry logic for transient failures.

**Data Processing:**
